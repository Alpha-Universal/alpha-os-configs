# alpha-os-configs
This repo contains all config files and modifications used to create Alpha OS.

Several versions of Alpha OS are currently needed to accommodate hardware and 
system workarounds, and each is given its own directory.  These versions are 
currently for the Litebook v1, the Centurion Ultra, and the base (which 
includes every other Alpha device).

Some configs (the preseed file in particular) are tailored to the given 
version of Alpha OS.  All standard configs are in the base and external 
directories, and any version-specific configs or adjustments are placed within 
directories named after that version.
