# alpha-os-configs
This repo contains all config files and modifications used to create Alpha OS.

Two versions of Alpha OS are currently needed to accommodate hardware and 
system workarounds, and each is given its own directory.  These versions are 
currently for the Litebook v1 and v2, and the base (which includes every other 
Alpha device).  The Litebook version differs from the base only in the 
installed packages, which will be listed out in a file.

Some configs are tailored to the given version of Alpha OS.  All standard 
configs are in the base and external directories, and any version-specific 
configs or adjustments are placed within directories named after that version.
